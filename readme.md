##Game Contest Server

This was my final project for COS 243 at Taylor University. The topic of the course was multi-tier web application development, specifically Ruby on Rails.

No, you probably won't find best practices or the "right" way of doing things here. But I sure learned a lot (and I think I'm in love with Ruby on Rails now.)
